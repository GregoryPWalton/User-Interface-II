        <p>I knew I wanted to be a coder from a young age. My father is a computer scientist, so computers (and computer games, obviously) have always been a part of my life. I took a few coding classes in high school, then decided to pursue a college degree, but as I was always working odd jobs to pay for tuition, I could never commit to a full track. I moved from Columbia, Maryland to Seattle, Washington last year to accept a job as an insurance agent, but it just wasn’t a good fit for me. My roommate is a software developer, and when he told me about Lambda I knew right away that it was time for me to become who I was meant to be. Now I’m here, I’m doing it, and it feels amazing.</p>
